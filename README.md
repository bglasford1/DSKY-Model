# DSKY-Model

This project works in conjunction with the AGC project.  The DSKY is the display/keyboard for the AGC.  As part of the AGC project, my first attempt at a DSKY was functional but not pretty.  I decided to 3D print an exact model of the DSKY and imbed the required electronics.  Instead of using LED indicators and 7-segment LEDs I chose to use a pair of LCD displays which makes the model much cleaner.  I could have placed the guts of the AGC DSKY into this model but I chose instead to drive the LCD displays and keyboard with three Arduino Nano Everys and drive those with a Raspberry Pi.  This gives me the ability to use this model as both a display for the AGC and as a standalone demonstrator by imbedding my simulator code.  The code will first look for a pulse on the CLK1 pin.  If the clock is present then it will use the Channel Bus and controls from the AGC.  If not it will start the simulator and run the simulation.
